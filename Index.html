                <p> Hi there! My name is Lynette Chiamaka Okoroike. I am currently in my late twenties
                and I currently reside in Rancho Cordova, just a 20 plus minute drive east of Sacramento, CA. 
                I graduated from Cal State University Northridge, located right outside of Los Angeles, CA, a few years ago with a Bachelors Degree in Communication Studies.
                After college, I did some jobs here and there, mostly in the social media marketing and the office assistant realms.
                I want to be a web developer all because of the creativity of building a website from scratch. </p>
            

                <p>Speaking of creativity, I absolutely love everything about the performing arts, especially Music and Theater, but not dance, because I am not a very good dancer.
                I have been playing drums and percussion for over six years and I absolutely loved it! I also played taiko for 2 years and was part of a taiko ensemble during that time. I would love to play taiko again.
                I used to sing, but my voice is not so good. I used to play piano, but I am not very good at it.
                I really wanted to play guitar, but didn't get to do it.
                I have taken a few acting classes, but after a lot of auditions, never got to act in a play. I absolutely love musicals! </p>
